subway-timer
==

**This doesn't do anything yet.**

This is a simple web application to record the amount of time it takes to travel
from one (NYC) subway station to another.

It is an experiment to work through a bunch of the gorey details around local
storage, offline applications and eventual remote pushing/storing of that data.
